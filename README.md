This project presents a complete machine learning pipeline for **binary image classification**, comparing classical machine learning models with deep learning approaches.

Check out my project here:  
[My GitHub Repo](https://github.com/iram100/pde4444_cw)

The goal is to classify images into:

*  **PASS** — Acceptable,  Upright Bottles
*  **FAIL** — Defective,  Horizontal/Tilted/Upside Down Bottles

This problem is commonly found in **automated quality inspection systems**, where visual defects must be detected reliably.
